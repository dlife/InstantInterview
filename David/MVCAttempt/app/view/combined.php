 * this page should create a controller,
 * make the controller perform its necessary actions,
 * then use the vars from the controller to combine the views.
 *
 * This page COULD be called with params to signal if it's called from marking a competence or selected a function.
 * Marking a competence is a much shorter flow than selecting a function
