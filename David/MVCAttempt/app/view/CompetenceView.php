/*  // should have available
    // - array of competence objects that will then be displayed.
    // - array of id's of the competence objects that should be marked.

    // foreach competence in the competaences array
    //     make a competence html part with
    //         - a checkbox (or similar)
    //         - a label for the control with value the actual competence
    //         - check if this needs to be marked
    //         - attach a trigger to notify a change when a competence is marked

marking a competence will request a new combined.php view because the questions sections is likely to be updated.
consider sending a param to notify this request comes from marking a competenc.
